📌Project Action Plan for 45% Final Assessment Project
Overview:
You’ll work in a team to design and deliver an AI-powered solution that creates real value for a defined audience. Use tools and techniques taught in the module, from prompt engineering and RAG to media generation, agents, and communication tools.

⚠️ We're releasing this project early to give you more prep time. Some tools will be covered after the brief is released.

✅What You Need to Do
💡Propose a Value-Driven AI Project (👥 10% Team Grade)
Assessment is team based. Everyone in the team gets the same grade for this component.

Identify a real-world problem, need, or opportunity.

Define your target audience or client clearly.

Explain why AI is both necessary and ethical in your solution.

Choose appropriate AI tools from the module.

Submit a Project Proposal into MSTeams before the close of June 5, Thursday, 23:59 (End of Week 7). A simple template, which you may modify but must retain sections will be provided. 

You will be assessed on Clarity of purpose, potential value creation, feasibility, document structure, team role planning and quality of deliverable. .

🛠️Design and Build Your AI Solution (👤 40% Individual Grade)
Assessment will be based on individual contributions to the project.

Use tools 🔧 such as Botpress, Flowise, Google AI Studio, Grok, Canva, GitHub CoPilot , or others taught in class.

If using tools not taught in class, seek lecturer approval first.

Your solution should demonstrate:

Prompt design – clear, modular, and effective (including chaining, templating, optimisation).

Agent logic or flow – reasoning, decision-making, or multi-agent structure.

Data retrieval – selection, cleaning, and structuring (e.g., for RAG).

Testing and iteration – show evidence of testing and improvement.

Tool integration – coordinated use of AI and creative tools.

Optional enhancements – visuals, voice, or interactivity that improve UX.

Use taught tools creatively to enhance your solution (e.g., Firefly, Canva).

📣Create a Promotional Package (👤 25% Individual Grade)
Present your solution as a polished product or prototype, not just a demo.

Your package should aim to inform, persuade, or engage your target audience.

Include at least two of the following elements:

A short product explainer video (e.g., avatar-led walkthrough or narrated prototype)

Branded visual identity (e.g., logo, banners, colour palette)

A short-form marketing campaign (e.g., TikTok-style mockups, Instagram carousel, social ad concept)

A one-page brochure or elevator-pitch aimed at your client or user group

Interactive demo experience (e.g., landing page mockup, chatbot simulation)

You will be assessed on clear message, visual appeal, quality, appropriateness, technical execution and integration of taught tools.

📊Prepare Your Final Report and Presentation Slide Deck (👥 25% Team Grade)
Assessment is team based. Everyone in the team gets the same grade for this component.

Compile a professional written report documenting your solution, including:

Problem definition and target audience

Design rationale and tool choices

Prompt examples and flow diagrams

Promotional artefacts created

Individual reflections on challenges, testing, and lessons learned

Submit final presentation slides suitable for client or stakeholder use

Assessment based on clarity, visual design, structure, content, audience awareness and technical quality.

🔍What We’re Looking For
A well-scoped AI solution that solves a meaningful problem for a defined audience
